# AI based Customer Profiling

## Overview

This project is aimed at creating a customer profiling system using AI and machine learning techniques. It provides a web-based interface for communication between the user and the AI models. The system is built using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. The main AI models are contained in the `AI based Customer Profiling.ipynb` Python script.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for interacting with the AI-based customer profiling system.
- Utilizes various AI models for customer segmentation, classification, and profiling.
- Easily extendable to incorporate additional AI models and features.

## Repository Structure

- `models`: Contains AI models used for customer profiling.
- `node_modules`: Required Node.js packages for the React frontend.
- `public`: Static files for the React app.
- `src`: Contains the Flask backend code in `app.py`.
- `AI based Customer Profiling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main AI models.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading.
- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: Node.js package files.

## Getting Started


1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FendiYassine/AI-based-Customer-Profiling.git
   cd AI-based-Customer-Profiling
   
2.Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

    cd src
    python app.py


4. In a separate terminal window:


      ```bash
      npm run start


## Usage
-Access the web application by following the "Getting Started" instructions.

-Interact with the AI-based customer profiling system through the web interface.

-Explore and modify the AI models in the "AI based Customer Profiling.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.
